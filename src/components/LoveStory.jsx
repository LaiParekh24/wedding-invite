                It all started with a simple cup of coffee in Santa Monica. What was supposed to be a quick 30-minute meeting turned into a four-hour conversation about travel, music, and our shared love for the ocean.
              </p>
              <p>
                From that day on, we were inseparable. We've traveled to over ten countries together, adopted a golden retriever named Sandy, and built a life filled with laughter and adventure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Three years later, on the same beach where we'll say "I do," Ethan asked the most important question of his life. And Sophia, with tears of joy, said yes.
